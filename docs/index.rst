Welcome to BAEC Model Generator SDK documentation!
==================================================

`Basetime <https://basetime.nl/>`_ and `CEMS BV <https://cemsbv.nl/>`_ are working
together on the development of the BAEC system/platform (Soil Movement Acquisition
and Extrapolation of Continuous
Measurements System, for its initials in Dutch Bodembeweging Acquisitie en
Extrapolatie van Continuemetingen), an advanced geotechnical measuring
system that improves the accuracy and reliability of settlement measurements
and predictions in the Netherlands.

BAEC uses advanced sensor technology, wireless communications and data
analysis to provide real-time insight into ground movements.

This system innovates by combining automatic, accurate and high-frequency
measurements of ground movement with analysis of subsidence measurement data
and short- and long-term forecasts. This addresses the problem of uncertainty
margins in settlement calculations, caused by heterogeneous soil compositions,
allowing for earlier and better decision making in the advance of construction
projects.

The BAEC system responds to increasing drought and flooding in the Netherlands,
which have consequences for the built environment and the groundwater level.
Furthermore, it anticipates the need for accurate measurements and predictions in a
digitized construction industry with a workforce shortage.
